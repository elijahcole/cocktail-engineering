# Black Manhattan 

## Ingredients

* 2 oz rye
* 0.5 oz Averna
* 1 dash Angostura bitters
* 1 dash orange bitters

## Instructions

Combine ingredients, stir with ice, strain, and serve up. Garnish with two brandied cherries. 

## Notes
* The traditional ratio is 2:1, but we prefer the less sweet 4:1 (especially after the sweetness added by the cherries).
