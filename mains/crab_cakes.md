## Notes
* Based on [this recipe](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/maryland-crab-cakes-with-quick-tartar-sauce.html).
* You can use imitation crab, but the cakes tend to not hold together so well. The recipe still works well, though. 
* If using real crab meat, check for hard bits. 
* If you don't have Old Bay, you can substitute 1/4 tsp. seasoned salt + 1/4 tsp. paprika.
