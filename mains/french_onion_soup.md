## Ingredients
* 6.5 medium yellow onions, sliced
* 12 oz. Gruy√®re, grated
* 1 baguette, sliced into rounds 1 inch thick
* 1 cup red wine
* 6 cups beef stock
* 3 tablespoons cognac
* cooking oil
* salt
* pepper
* sugar
* butter

## Instructions
1. Slice onions. Set aside the slices from half an onion for step 12. 
2. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and a drizzle of oil in an oven-safe pot over medium-low heat. 
3. Add onions and stir occasionally until tender and translucent, 20-25 minutes. 
4. Add 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt and raise heat to medium-high. Stir frequently until brown and caramelized, 25-35 minutes. 
5. Meanwhile, preheat the oven the 325F. 
6. Slice baguette into enough 1-inch slices to cover the surface of the soup. Arrange baguette slices on a baking sheet.
7. Bake for 10-15 minutes, flip slices, brush olive oil onto each slice, and bake for a further 10-15 minutes. 
8. Preheat the oven to 350F. 
9. Once the onions are caramelized, reduce heat to medium, add 3 tablespoons flour, 1 tablespoon butter, and cook for 3 minutes. 
10. Add stock, scrape fond from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon, and bring to simmer. 
11. Add wine, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 30 minutes.
12. Add 3 tablespoons cognac, 1/2 sliced raw onion, a handful of the grated cheese, and stir. 
13. Season to taste. 
14. Arrange baked baguette slices in a layer on the surface of the soup.
15. Cover the entire surface with the rest of the cheese.
16. Drizzle with oil.
17. Move pot to oven (uncovered) and cook for 25-30 minutes. 
18. Broil to brown the cheese.
19. Let cool for 10 minutes, then serve. 

## Notes
* Slightly simplified version of Julia Child's recipe. 
* A 3.5 qt. dutch oven works well for this recipe. 
* Chicken stock also works fine. 
* Cognac can be replaced with similar spirits. 
* Makes 4 substantial bowls.
