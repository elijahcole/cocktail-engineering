# Brandied Cherries

## Ingredients
* 1 jar Amarena cherries
* 2 parts cognac
* 1 part amaretto
* 1 part Drambuie

## Instructions
1. Boil water and sterilize a Mason jar with the same volume as the jar of cherries.
2. Drain the syrup from the cherries - it's fine if there's a bit left, no need to rinse or anything like that.
3. Add cherries to the Mason jar. 
4. Add liquid ingredients (in the ratio given above) until the cherries are submerged.
5. Seal jar and refrigerate.

## Notes
* These seem to remain good for a very long time (> 1 year).
