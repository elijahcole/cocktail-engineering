# Ingredients

* 8 oz. gin
* 8 oz. sweet vermouth
* 8 oz. Campari

# Instructions

To prepare:
1. Combine all ingredients in a 750 mL bottle.
2. Chill in the freezer.


To serve:
1. Add ice to a rocks glass.
2. Pour the desired amount over the ice.
3. Stir.

# Notes
* Batched cocktails usually include water as an ingredient to provide dilution. However, I think it's best to leave water out of a batched Negroni recipe. The reason is flexibility: a pre-diluted Negroni becomes too weak if served over small ice cubes, but this recipe works with small or large ice cubes. Using large ice cubes just requires a little more stirring in the glass.
