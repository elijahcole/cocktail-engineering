# Instructions

To prepare:
1. Add eggs to blender.
2. Turn on the blender (low setting), leaving the top off.
3. With the blender running, **slowly and carefully** add the rest of the ingredients.

To store: 
1. Pour eggnog into a sterilized 750 mL storage container.
2. Seal container and store in the refrigerator.
3. Leave to age.

To serve: 
1. Pour into a chilled glass.
2. Garnish with nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice.

# Notes
* These recipes benefit from aging (sealed, in the refrigerator). In the past I have gone up to 3 months and never had a batch spoil. 
* The eggnog may separate after sitting in the refrigerator for a while, but it re-integrates easily with a good shake. 
* It may or may not matter, but I typically add the ingredients to the blender in the following order: eggs, dairy, sugar, batch-specific ingredients. 
* The storage containers can be sterilized by **carefully** rinsing with almost-boiling water. 
* All batches were created on 2021/09/23.
